Rock Paper Scissor
==================

Just a simple test to practice python

This script tries random combinations on the common game "Rock Paper Scissor"
and computes the probability of winning the game with your chosen weapon.

As suggested in a normal game, every weapon has the change of 33.333333...%to win


Some people here in germany plays that game with "well" (Brunnen), but its unfair.
The well has a chance of 39.91% to win - every other weapon just 19.xx%

I also tried rock_paper_scissor_lizard_spock - as mentioned in "The Big Bang Theory".
Its also a balanced game where each weapon has a change of 20% to win

You can also see the "power" of a weapon within its definition:
    "How many weapons beat weaponX"

As you can see in this example:

    ROCK   : ( SCISSOR ),
    WELL   : ( SCISSOR, ROCK )
